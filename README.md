# milvus
here we are trying to do an embedding search for sentences by using Milvus and MongoDB. At first, we need docker to can run Milvus on it and then, we build Word2Vec to embed my sentence and then we add it by indexing to both databases.

for running docker --> 'docker-compose -f milvus-standalone-docker-compose.yml up'
